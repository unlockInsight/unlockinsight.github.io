> A fourth value in teaching science is to teach how things are found out.  The value of questioning, the value of free ideas – not only for the development of science, but the value of free ideas in every field – becomes apparent.  Science is a way to teach how something gets to be known, what is not known, to what extent things are known (for nothing is known absolutely), how to handle doubt and uncertainty, what the rules of evidence are, how to think about things so that judgments can be made, how to distinguish truth from fraud, and from show.  These are certainly important secondary yields of teaching science, and physics in particular.
