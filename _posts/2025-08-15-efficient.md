> You should obsess over risks that do permanent damage and care little about risks that do temporary harm, but the opposite is more common.  
> The only way to build wealth is to have a gap between your ego and your income.  
> **A lot of financial debates are just people with different time horizons talking over each other.**  
> **If your expectations grow faster than your income you’ll never be happy with your money no matter how much you accumulate.**  
> Most of what people call “conviction” is a willful disregard for new information that might make you change your mind. That’s when beliefs turn dangerous.  
> People have vastly different desires, except for three things: Respect, feeling useful, and control over their time. Those are nearly universal.  
> The market is rational but investors play different games and those games look irrational to people playing a different game.  
> History is driven by surprising events but forecasting is driven by obvious ones.  
> **For many people the process of becoming wealthier feels better than having wealth.**  
> Every market valuation is a number from today multiplied by a story about tomorrow.  
> **People learn when they’re surprised. Not when they read the right answer, or are told they’re doing it wrong, but when they experience a gap between expectations and reality.**  
> **People tend to know what makes them angry with more certainty than what might make them happy. Happiness is complicated because you keep moving the goalposts. Misery is more predictable.**  
> **Money’s greatest intrinsic value is its ability to give you control over your time.**  
> **There’s more to learn from people who endured risk than those who seemingly conquered it, because the kind of skills you need to endure risk are more likely repeatable and relevant to future risks.**  
> Most people can afford to not be a great investor. But they can’t afford to be a bad investor.  
> Woodrow Wilson talked about whether something was accountable to Darwin or accountable to Newton. It’s a useful idea. Everything is accountable to one of the two, and you have to know whether something adapts and changes over time or perpetually stays the same.  
> **Tell people what they want to hear and you can be wrong indefinitely without penalty.**  
> **When and where you were born can have a bigger impact on your outcome in life than anything you do intentionally.**  
> **Everyone is making a bet on an unknown future. It’s only called speculation when you disagree with someone else’s bet.**  
> **The same traits needed for outlier success are the same traits that increase the odds of failure. The line between bold and reckless is thin. So be careful blindly praising successes or criticizing failures, as they often made similar decisions with slightly different levels of luck.**  
> **There is an optimal net worth for most people, after which not only does happiness stop increasing but more money becomes a social and psychological liability. The number is different for everyone, but is probably lower than most people think.**  
> **Risk management is less about how you respond to risk and more about recognizing how many things can go wrong before they actually do.**  
> Asking what the biggest risks are is like asking what you expect to be surprised about. If you knew what the biggest risk was you would do something about it, and doing something about it makes it less risky. What your imagination can’t fathom is the dangerous stuff, and it’s why risk can never be mastered.  
> A lot of good writing makes points that people already intuitively know but haven’t yet put into words. It works because readers learn something new without having to expend much energy questioning whether it’s true. The alternatives are points that are obvious and well known (boring) or something that’s non-obvious and unknown (often takes too much effort to understand and impatient readers leave).  
> **Small risks are overblown because they’re easy to talk about, big risks are discounted and ignored because they seem preposterous before they arrive.**  
> **Most problems are more complicated than they look but most solutions should be simpler than they are.**  
> If something is impossible to know you are better off not being very smart, because smart people fool themselves into thinking they know while average people are more likely to shrug their shoulders and end up closer to reality.  
> **Risk’s greatest fuels are leverage, overconfidence, ego, and impatience. Its greatest antidote is having options, humility, and other people’s trust.**
